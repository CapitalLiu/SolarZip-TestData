# SolarZip-TestData

This repository contains example datasets used in the SolarZip paper.
## Description

The sample images used to generate the figures in this paper are stored in folders named after the corresponding figure numbers. Each folder contains the original FITS file and the reconstructed FITS files generated after compression and decompression by the compressors.

**Original File Name**:

Example: `solo_L2_eui-hrieuv174-image_20240405T225348216_V01.fits`  
  - `L2`: Data level.  
  - `hrieuv174`: Observing instrument.  
  - The numbers represent the observation time.

**Reconstructed File Name**:

Example: `SolarZip_cr_831.fits`  
  - Indicates the reconstructed data from the SolarZip compressor at a compression ratio of 831.
